# Un-P2SH

## Setup

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are expected to be set / available to the application. For development, you can create a file named `.env` in the application root folder with these variables set (e.g. `PORT=3000`) and they will be loaded automatically on server start.  This practice is _not_ recommended for production servers.

| Var        | Example    | Description                       |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| PORT       | 3000       | Port app should listen on         |
| PGUSER     | clemensley | Postgres database user            |
| PGPASSWORD |            | Postgres user password (optional) |
| PGHOST     | locahost   | Postgres host                     |
